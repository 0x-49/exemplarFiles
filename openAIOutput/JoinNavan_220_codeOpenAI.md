Creating a comprehensive and immersive webpage for the Professional Services Industry using Node.js and Shadcn UI components involves a multifaceted approach. Below, I present a detailed TypeScript code structure that incorporates all the necessary elements while maintaining a focus on UI design, user engagement, and effective sales copy. The following code outlines a server-side application using Node.js, with a rich front-end presentation utilizing Shadcn components.

### TypeScript Code for Professional Services Industry Page

```typescript
// server.ts
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Route to serve the Professional Services page
app.get('/professional-services', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'professional-services.html'));
