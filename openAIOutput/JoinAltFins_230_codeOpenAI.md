Creating a captivating and comprehensive webpage for the **altFINS Bounty Program** is crucial for engaging users and encouraging participation in a vibrant community. This guide will walk you through building a Node.js application that utilizes ShadCN components to create a visually stunning and effective landing page. Below, I’ll provide a detailed and expansive TypeScript code, complemented by rich descriptions, explanations of features, use cases, and an extensive FAQ section.

### Comprehensive TypeScript Code Structure

First, let’s set up the basic structure for our Node.js application. We will create an Express server that serves our bounty program page.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware for serving static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Route for the bounty program page
app.get('/bounty-program', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'bountyProgram.html'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Page Breakdown: `bountyProgram.html`

Now let's create the `bountyProgram.html` file within the `public` directory, making sure to incorporate ShadCN components for a visually appealing experience.
