### Explanation of the Code

1. **Setup**: The code initializes an Express application, sets up middleware to serve static files, and defines a route to serve the main page.

2. **HTML Structure**: The HTML is structured according to the provided outline, with clear sections for the hero, features, benefits, how it works, testimonials, pricing, FAQs, and the footer.

3. **Dynamic Content**: Each section contains descriptive and persuasive text designed to engage users and encourage them to convert.

4. **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Prominent CTA buttons are included to guide users toward starting their free trial and watching a demo.

5. **Styling and Responsiveness**: While this code does not include CSS, it is structured to allow easy integration with a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) for styling purposes.

6. **Accessibility and SEO**: Semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are used to improve accessibility and SEO.

### Next Steps

1. **Styling**: Create a `styles.css` file to style the components. Use Shadcn components for buttons, cards, and other UI elements to achieve a visually appealing design.

2. **Component Integration**: Integrate Shadcn components using the specified commands for richer UI experiences, such as animations, hover effects, and responsive designs.

3. **Testing and Deployment**: Test the application locally and deploy it using a cloud service or a hosting provider to make it accessible to users.

4. **Analytics and Tracking**: Integrate analytics to track user interactions and optimize the page for better conversion rates.

5. **Content Management**: Consider using a CMS or a database to manage content dynamically rather than hardcoding it into the HTML.
