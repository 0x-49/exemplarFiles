This page is a well-crafted amalgamation of educational, informative, and engaging content aimed at catering to a diverse audience, including business travelers, travel managers, finance teams, and executive assistants. 

#### Page Layout and Structure

**1. Header Section**

At the forefront of our page design is the **Header Section**, which encapsulates the essence of our brand with its clear and user-friendly layout.

- **Title:** "Resources"
  - The title is prominently displayed at the top, utilizing a bold, modern sans-serif font that aligns with Navan's branding. This not only enhances readability but also provides a contemporary feel that resonates with our target audience. The use of Navan's signature blue (#1A73E8) for the title ensures it stands out against the backdrop of darker hues, establishing a strong visual hierarchy.

- **Subtitle:** "Explore our latest insights, guides, and tools to streamline your travel and expense management."
  - The subtitle is intentionally designed to be smaller and lighter, employing a medium gray (#4A5568) to maintain a level of subtlety that complements the bold title. This balance draws the reader's attention without overwhelming them.

- **Navigation Bar:**
  - Below the header, a horizontal navigation bar is strategically placed, enabling users to filter content effortlessly by category. The inclusion of categories like **Blogs**, **Guides**, **Tools & Templates**, **Case Studies**, and **Glossary** ensures that users can find exactly what they need with minimal friction.
  - Each tab features a hover effect that shifts the text color to blue and adds a subtle underline, enhancing the interactive experience and providing visual feedback.
