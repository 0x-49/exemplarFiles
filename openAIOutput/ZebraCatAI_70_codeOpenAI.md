### **TypeScript Code Structure**

Here's a simplified version of how the TypeScript code might look for implementing this functionality in a Node.js environment. The example focuses on handling video uploads and the AI processing logic.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import multer from 'multer';
import { AIService } from './services/AIService';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware for handling file uploads
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname); // Unique file name
  },
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

// API Endpoint to handle video uploads
app.post('/upload', upload.single('video'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userPrompt = req.body.prompt;
    const videoPath = req.file.path;

    // Process the video using AI
    const processedVideo = await AIService.processVideo(videoPath, userPrompt);

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'Video processed successfully!',
      processedVideoURL: processedVideo.url,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing video:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error processing video.' });
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### **AI Processing Service**

The `AIService` would be an abstraction layer responsible for integrating with the AI models that handle video processing:

```typescript
// services/AIService.ts
import { VideoProcessingAI } from 'ai-video-processing-sdk'; // Hypothetical SDK

export class AIService {
  static async processVideo(videoPath: string, prompt: string) {
    // Integrate with AI model for video processing
    const result = await VideoProcessingAI.transform(videoPath, {
      prompt,
      quality: '1080p',
    });

    return result; // Return the processed video details
  }
}
```

### **Conclusion of the Code Structure**

This code lays the groundwork for a robust video processing feature on the Zebracat.ai platform. By utilizing Node.js and TypeScript, the implementation ensures scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.
