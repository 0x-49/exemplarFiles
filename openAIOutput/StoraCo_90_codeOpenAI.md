# Comprehensive TypeScript Code for Stora Community Page

Below is the complete TypeScript code for the Stora Community Page, designed with Node.js in mind. This code structure emphasizes the integration of ShadCN components, ensuring that the UI is both beautiful and functional. The code includes all necessary components, features, and sections as described in the outline, along with an extensive FAQ section. 

### 1. Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mkdir stora-community-page
cd stora-community-page
npm init -y
npm install express typescript @types/express ts-node shadcn
```

Then, create a `tsconfig.json` file for TypeScript configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

### 2. Create the Server

Create a new file called `server.ts` in the `src` directory.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files from the public directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Home route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### 3. Create the Frontend

Create an `index.html` file in the `src` directory. This file will contain the primary structure of the Stora Community Page.

```

### 4. Styling the Page

Create a `styles.css` file in the `src` directory to style the Community Page.

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

.header {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #1A2B5F, #FF6B35);
    color: white;
    padding: 50px 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

.hero-section {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.cta-buttons {
    margin-top: 20px;
}

.cta-button {
    background-color: #FF6B35;
    border: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    cursor: pointer;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

.navbar {
    background-color: #333;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

.navbar ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

.navbar li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 15px;
}

.navbar a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}

.forum-section, .networking-section, .events-section, .resources-section, .testimonials-section, .faq-section {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: white;
    margin: 20px auto;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.forum-cards, .networking-profiles, .event-calendar, .resource-cards, .testimonial-carousel {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
}

.forum-card, .profile-card, .event-card, .resource-card, .testimonial-card {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
    width: 30%;
    background-color: #fff;
}

.join-button, .connect-button, .register-button, .download-button {
    background-color: #FF6B35;
    border: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;

    border-radius: 5px;
}

.footer {
    background-color: #1A2B5F;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 20px;
}

.footer-links a {
    color: white;
    margin: 0 10px;
}
```

### 5. Adding Interactivity

Create a `script.js` file in the `src` directory to handle any interactivity you may want to add.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // Example of a simple interactivity for FAQ section
    const faqItems = document.querySelectorAll('.faq-item h3');

    faqItems.forEach(item => {
        item.addEventListener('click', () => {
            item.nextElementSibling.classList.toggle('active');
        });
    });
});
```

### 6. Running the Project

To run the server, use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node src/server.ts
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the Stora Community Page in action!

### 7. Features and Use Cases Expanded

The Stora Community Page, as described above, is not merely a collection of sections but a thoughtfully designed platform tailored for self-storage business owners and operators. Below, I expand upon the features and use cases.

#### A. Community Forum

The Community Forum serves as the beating heart of the Stora Community. Here, users can engage in meaningful dialogue regarding various aspects of their businesses.

Networking is essential for any business's growth. The networking section allows members to connect with industry peers, fostering relationships that can lead to partnerships, collaborations, or even mentorships.
