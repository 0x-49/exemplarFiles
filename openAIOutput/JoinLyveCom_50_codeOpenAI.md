Given your request for a comprehensive TypeScript code structure for a Social Proof page using Node.js and the ShadCN components, I'll draft a detailed implementation. I'll also incorporate rich text and depth of explanation to meet the 4500+ words requirement you mentioned. This response will include the TypeScript code for the page, along with elaborate explanations of each component, use cases, and a detailed FAQ section.

### Comprehensive TypeScript Code for LyveComâ€™s Social Proof Page

Before we dive into the coding structure, let's outline the key components that we will be using from the ShadCN library as per your request. Each component will be meticulously crafted to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

#### 1. Project Setup

To begin, let's set up our Node.js application and install the necessary packages. 

```bash
mkdir lyvecom-social-proof
cd lyvecom-social-proof
npm init -y
npm install express typescript @types/node @shadcn/ui
npx tsc --init
```

#### 2. Directory Structure

We'll maintain a clean directory structure:

```
