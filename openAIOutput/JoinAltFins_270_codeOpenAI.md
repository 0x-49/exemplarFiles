const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/public/index.html');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);

    <div class="hero-content">
        <h1>Stay Ahead with Real-Time Crypto Events</h1>

        <button class="cta-button">Explore Upcoming Events</button>
    </div>
</div>

<style>
.hero {
    background-image: url('path/to/your/background-image.jpg');
    color: white;
    padding: 50px;
    text-align: center;
}
.cta-button {
    background-color: #00A3FF; /* Electric Blue */

    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;

$(document).ready(function(){

    background-color: #00C853; /* Green for positive events */
    color: white;

### Event Details Modal

Clicking an event card should reveal more information in a modal.

```html
<div id="event-details-modal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <span class="close-button">&times;</span>
        <h2>Event Title</h2>

    position: fixed;
    z-index: 1; /* Sit on top */
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%; /* Full width */
    height: 100%; /* Full height */
    overflow: auto; /* Enable scroll if needed */
    background-color: rgb(0,0,0); /* Fallback color */
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4); /* Black w/ opacity */
}
</style>
```

### Alerts Section

    <ul id="alert-list">
        <!-- List of alerts will be generated here -->

    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #F5F5F5; /* Light gray background */
}
</style>
```

## Backend Implementation

To manage events, alerts, and user interactions, you'll need a backend setup. For this, you might want to use a simple JSON file or a database like MongoDB.

### Step 1: Create a Sample Data File

Create a `data.json` file in your project root:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Binance Listing: XYZ Coin",
        "date": "2023-04-01T10:00:00Z",
        "description": "A new coin listing on Binance.",
        "type": "listing"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "AMA with Project ABC",
        "date": "2023-04-02T15:00:00Z",
        "description": "Join us for an AMA with the team behind Project ABC.",
        "type": "ama"
    }
]
```

### Step 2: Set Up Routes to Serve Events

In your `server.js`, create routes to fetch events.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

app.get('/api/events', (req, res) => {
    fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, 'data.json'), (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to load events' });
        }
        res.json(JSON.parse(data));
    });
});
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Frontend

Use AJAX to fetch events and populate the event cards dynamically.

```javascript
// public/js/app.js
$(document).ready(function() {
    $.get('/api/events', function(events) {
        events.forEach(event => {
            $('#alert-list').append(`
                <li>${event.title} - ${event.date}</li>
            `);
        });
    });
});
```
