# Comprehensive Code Implementation for the Detailed Case Studies Page

Below is a complete implementation of the **Detailed Case Studies** page for **Stora**, crafted with Node.js in mind, while utilizing ShadCN components for a beautiful UI design. This will not only provide a rich user experience but also serve as a powerful sales tool. 

## 1. Setting Up the Node.js Environment

Before we dive into the code, let’s make sure we have a Node.js environment set up. Ensure you have Node.js installed, and then create a new project directory. Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir stora-case-studies
cd stora-case-studies
npm init -y
npm install express ejs body-parser
```

This setup will create an Express.js server that will render our page using EJS templates.

## 2. Project Structure

Create the following directory structure:

```
stora-case-studies/
├── public/
│   └── styles.css
├── views/
│   ├── index.ejs
└── app.js
```

## 3. Setting Up the Express App

In `app.js`, set up your Node.js server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Home route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index');
});

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## 4. Creating the EJS Template

Now, let’s create our main page in `views/index.ejs`. This page will be rich with content, visuals, and interactions. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
