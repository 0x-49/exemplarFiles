Creating a comprehensive, user-friendly, and visually engaging Virtual Assistant Services page on Wishup requires a multifaceted approach that combines effective design principles, compelling copy, and advanced functionality. Below, I provide a detailed TypeScript code that implements the various components outlined in the page description. This code is structured with Node.js in mind, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js or NestJS. Additionally, the code takes advantage of the ShadCN component library to enhance the UI with beautiful components.
