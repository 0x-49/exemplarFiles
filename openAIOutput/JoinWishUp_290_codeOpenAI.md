### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports and Dependencies**: 
   - The above code imports React and various ShadCN components such as `Button`, `TableOfContents`, `HeroSection`, and `Footer`. This modular design allows for reusable components that enhance maintainability and readability.

2. **Component Structure**:
   - The `TermsAndConditions` component encapsulates all page elements, ensuring that everything is neatly organized within a single React functional component.
   - It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive and clean layout.

3. **Hero Section**:
   - The `HeroSection` component serves as an introduction, prominently displaying the title and subtitle to welcome users to the Terms and Conditions page.

4. **Table of Contents**:
   - A clickable `TableOfContents` component allows users to easily navigate to specific sections, enhancing user experience, especially in longer documents.

   - Each section (e.g., Introduction, User Responsibilities, etc.) is clearly defined with headings and structured text. Lists are utilized for clarity, making it easier for users to digest important information.

6. **Call-to-Action Buttons**:
   - Three buttons guide users to other important sections of the website, such as the Contact page, Privacy Policy, and the homepage. This interaction is crucial for improving user engagement and accessibility.

7. **Footer Section**:
   - A `Footer` component is included to close the document, providing additional navigation and information related to the site.
