Creating a detailed and expansive Privacy Policy page requires a meticulous approach to design, content, and user experience. Below, I will provide a comprehensive Typescript code structure that leverages the capabilities of Node.js, along with a rich descriptive narrative to enhance the understanding of the various components involved. The aim is to create an immersive experience for the user, ensuring clarity and engagement throughout the page.

### TypeScript Code Implementation for the Wishup Privacy Policy Page

```typescript
// Importing necessary libraries
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import path from 'path';

// Initializing the express application
const app = express();

// Middleware setup
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Setting up the routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'index.html'));
});

app.get('/privacy-policy', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'privacy-policy.html'));
});

// Starting the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### HTML Structure for Privacy Policy Page

For the Privacy Policy page, we will structure it in a way that is conducive to readability and user engagement. Below is an HTML template that should be saved as `privacy-policy.html` in the `views` directory.

```html
