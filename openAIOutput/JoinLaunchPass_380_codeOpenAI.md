Creating a comprehensive and engaging landing page for the **Content Creators** niche on LaunchPass requires a careful balance of descriptive text, technical implementation, and aesthetic appeal. Below, I present a detailed TypeScript code structure for a Node.js application that utilizes ShadCN components to bring the page to life. This page will be rich in features, use cases, and an extensive FAQ section to better serve the needs of content creators.

```typescript
// Import necessary libraries and components
import express from 'express';
import { Hero, FeatureTile, UseCaseCard, TestimonialCard, PricingPlan, FAQAccordion, Footer } from 'shadcn';

// Initialize the Express application
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware for serving static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Template for the Content Creators Page
app.get('/content-creators', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

                    subheadline="Turn your YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok audience into a thriving paid community. LaunchPass helps you keep control, provide exclusive experiences, and generate recurring revenue—all in minutes."
