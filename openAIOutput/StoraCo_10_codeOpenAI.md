Creating a comprehensive product page for Stora requires a meticulous approach to ensure that every aspect of the page is engaging, informative, and designed to convert visitors into users. Below, I present a detailed breakdown of the Stora product page utilizing Node.js for backend functionalities and incorporating beautiful ShadCN components for a modern user interface. The goal is to provide a rich, immersive experience while ensuring clarity and accessibility throughout the user journey.

### Stora Product Page: TypeScript Code

To effectively implement the Stora product page, we will utilize TypeScript for type safety, ensuring robust backend development with Node.js. The ShadCN components will enhance the user interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

import { FooterSection } from './components/FooterSection';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(render(<App />));
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
