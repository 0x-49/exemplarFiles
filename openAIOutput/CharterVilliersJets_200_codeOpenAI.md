      <h2>Optimal Booking Windows for Domestic and International Flights</h2>
      <p>
        Timing is crucial when it comes to private jet bookings. For domestic flights, it is recommended to book at least 2-3 weeks in advance, while international flights may require 4-6 weeks of notice. This allows you to secure the best rates and availability.

        Booking early provides several advantages, including better pricing and a wider selection of aircraft. However, it may also limit flexibility should your plans change.
      </p>
      <h2>Last-Minute Bookings: Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p>
        While last-minute bookings can sometimes yield cheaper rates, they come with risks, including limited availability and higher costs. Understanding when and how to make these bookings can ensure you are prepared for any situation.
      </p>
      <h2>Expert Tips for Planning Your Private Jet Journey</h2>
