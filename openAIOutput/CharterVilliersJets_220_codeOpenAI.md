## Implementation in TypeScript with Node.js

Now, let’s translate this vision into a functional webpage using TypeScript and Node.js. Below is a sample code outline to guide you in creating the Pet-Friendly Travel page.

### Setting Up the Project

First, ensure you have Node.js installed, and then set up a new project:

```bash
mkdir villiers-jets
cd villiers-jets
npm init -y
npm install express typescript @types/express ts-node nodemon
```

### TypeScript Configuration

Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

### Setting Up the Express Server

Create a directory called `src` and inside it, create a file named `server.ts`:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files from the public directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Home route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Creating the HTML Structure

Inside the `src` directory, create a `public` folder and an `index.html` file. Here’s a simplified structure you might use:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Discover the ultimate pet-friendly private jet experience with Villiers Jets. Travel in comfort and style with your furry friends. Request a quote today!">
