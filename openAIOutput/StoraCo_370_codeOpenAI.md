### Example TypeScript Code for the Stora Contact Page

Here is a comprehensive TypeScript code snippet utilizing Node.js. This code can serve as a foundation for the Contact Page, integrating various features discussed in the description.

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { Server } from 'socket.io';

const app = express();
const server = createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

// Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public')); // Serve static files

// Nodemailer setup
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'Gmail',
    auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // your email
        pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS  // your email password
    }
});

// Contact form endpoint
app.post('/api/contact', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const { name, email, phone, message, inquiryType } = req.body;

    // Validate input
    if (!name || !email || !message) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Name, email, and message are required.' });
    }

    // Email options
    const mailOptions = {
        from: email,
        to: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // your email
        subject: `New contact form submission from ${name}`,
        text: `You have received a new message from ${name} (${email}, ${phone}) regarding ${inquiryType}:\n\n${message}`
    };

    // Send email
    transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
        if (error) {
            return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to send email.' });
        }
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Your message has been sent successfully!' });
    });
});

// Real-time chat using Socket.io
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('New client connected');

    socket.on('sendMessage', (message) => {
        io.emit('newMessage', message);
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected');
    });
});

// Serve the Contact Page
app.get('/contact', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/public/contact.html');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Express Framework**: The code utilizes the Express.js framework, which simplifies the creation of web servers in Node.js. 

2. **Body Parser Middleware**: This allows the server to parse incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle form submissions.

3. **Nodemailer Setup**: This module is used to send emails. You need to set up your email credentials in environment variables.

4. **Contact Form Endpoint**: The `/api/contact` endpoint processes form submissions. It validates the input, constructs an email, and sends it via Nodemailer.

5. **Real-time Chat with Socket.io**: This feature allows users to communicate with support representatives in real-time. The server listens for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients.

6. **Static Files**: The server serves static files from the `public` directory, which would include your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the Contact Page.

7. **Start the Server**: Finally, the server listens on a specified port, either from the environment variable or defaulting to 3000.
