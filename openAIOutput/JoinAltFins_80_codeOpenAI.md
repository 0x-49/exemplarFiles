          <h2>What is Trend Trading?</h2>
          <p>
            Trend trading is a trading strategy that involves analyzing price movements to determine the overall market direction. 
            Understanding market trends—whether they are upward, downward, or sideways—is crucial for successful trading.
          </p>
          <p>Here are the key concepts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Uptrend:</strong> A series of higher highs and higher lows.</li>
            <li><strong>Downtrend:</strong> A series of lower highs and lower lows.</li>
            <li><strong>Sideways Trend:</strong> A period of consolidation where prices move within a range.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Are Moving Averages?</h2>
          <p>
            Moving averages (MAs) are used to smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. They help traders identify the direction of the trend.
          </p>
          <p>There are different types of moving averages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Moving Average (SMA):</strong> The arithmetic mean of a set of prices over a specified number of periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Exponential Moving Average (EMA):</strong> A type of moving average that gives more weight to the most recent prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted Moving Average (WMA):</strong> A moving average that assigns a specific weight to each price point.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Do Moving Average Crossovers Work?</h2>
          <p>
            Moving average crossovers occur when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average. 
            These crossovers can signal potential buying or selling opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>bullish crossover</strong> happens when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, indicating a potential buy signal. Conversely, a <strong>bearish crossover</strong> occurs when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA, signaling a potential sell signal.
