### **12. Implementation with Node.js and shadcn Components**

To implement the above features and components using Node.js with shadcn UI components, you would create a server-side application that renders the support page dynamically. Below is an example of how to structure the code:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'support.html'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

**In your HTML file (support.html)**, you can leverage shadcn components to create the UI elements as described in the support page breakdown. Each component can be imported using the commands provided earlier, such as:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/kokonutd/button-shiny"
npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/navbar-menu"
```

**Example of using shadcn components in HTML:**

```html
