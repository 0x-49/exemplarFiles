- **Responsive Design**: A grid layout ensures that the episodes adjust according to the user's screen size, maintaining a seamless browsing experience.

**3. PodcastCategories**
- **Navigation Optimization**: This section helps users find content that aligns with their interests, promoting further exploration of available resources.
- **Visual Cues**: The use of icons adds a visual element that aids in quick recognition and categorization, making the browsing experience intuitive.

**4. Testimonials**
