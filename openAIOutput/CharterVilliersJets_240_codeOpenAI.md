Certainly! Below is a full TypeScript code implementation designed for a Node.js environment that captures the spirit of the Villiers Jets Blog Page titled "Christmas Greetings". The code integrates ShadCN components for a beautiful UI, which enhances the user experience. As requested, I've included comprehensive explanations, rich content, and a detailed FAQ section to create a robust and engaging web page.

### TypeScript Code Implementation

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import React from 'react';
import App from './App'; // Main App component
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

// Initialize Express
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware for serving static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Route for the main blog page
app.get('/christmas-greetings', (req, res) => {
    const helmet = Helmet.renderStatic();
    const html = renderToString(<App />);
    
    res.send(`
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            ${helmet.title.toString()}
            ${helmet.meta.toString()}
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="root">${html}</div>
            <script src="bundle.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>
    `);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
