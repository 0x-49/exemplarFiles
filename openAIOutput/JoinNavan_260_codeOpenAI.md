### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Component Structure**: The `SustainabilityPage` component organizes the entire page into distinct sections, each represented by its own subcomponent (e.g., `HeroSection`, `CommitmentOverview`, etc.). This modular approach promotes reusability and maintainability.

2. **Styling**: Each section uses Material-UI components for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design. You can customize the styles further to match the desired aesthetic.

3. **Dynamic Content**: Features like `featuresData` and testimonials are dynamically rendered based on the data structure, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

4. **Accessibility**: The use of semantic HTML elements (like `Typography`, `Button`, etc.) ensures better accessibility for users with assistive technologies.

5. **Interactive Elements**: Buttons are styled to stand out and encourage user interaction. You can further enhance interactivity by adding animations or hover effects.

6. **Mockup Components**: Placeholder components like `MockupDashboard`, `TestimonialsCarousel`, and `PartnersList` are included to visually represent data and encourage future development.

### Conclusion

This TypeScript code serves as a comprehensive framework for the Navan Sustainability Page, emphasizing user engagement and aesthetic appeal. The detailed structure allows for an immersive experience, promoting Navan's commitment to sustainability while clearly conveying the features and benefits to potential clients.
