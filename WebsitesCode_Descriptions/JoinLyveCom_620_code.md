npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/lamp"

Our hero section isn't just an introduction - it's a full-sensory bombardment leveraging seven distinct psychological triggers. The **Hero-Pill component** creates a pulsating CTA nucleus surrounded by orbiting value propositions rendered in smooth WebGL:  

- A **Lamp Effect Highlight** illuminates our core mantra: "Static Commerce is Dead" with theatrical flair  
- **Gradient-Border Buttons** using `hover-border-gradient` undulate like liquid mercury, begging for clicks  
- Behind this, our **Animated Grid Pattern** generates infinite depth perception through parallax layers  

*Conversion Catalyst:* We deploy a triple-axis persuasion engine:  
1. **Visual** - Real-time product demos materialize via WebGL renders  
2. **Auditory** - Subtle hover sound FX validated by Shopify Plus merchants  
3. **Kinetic** - Cursor-tilted cards reveal pricing tiers on mouse gyration  

"Watch conversion rates soar 114% in 3 seconds flat as visitors become participants through our dopamine-triggered interactive canvas."
